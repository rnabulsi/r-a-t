 3. Open cmake/AtmineConfig.cmake file and configure classes. Reasonable defaults are there.
 4. Check the database schema, username and password in common/atmineconfiguration.cpp
 5. Go outside source directory with cd ..
 6. Create build directory with mkdir build
 7. Enter build directory with cd build
 8. Prepare the code for building with cmake ../atmine
 9. Build the code with make
10. Run tests with make test
